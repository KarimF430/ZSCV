# How to Push to GitHub

Your code is ready to push! Your repository is already configured to:
`https://github.com/KarimF430/ZSCV.git`

## Quick Options:

### Option 1: GitHub Desktop (Easiest)
1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. File → Clone Repository → `KarimF430/ZSCV`
4. Push your changes from the app

### Option 2: Use Personal Access Token

**Step 1:** Create a Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "Vercel Deployment"
4. Select scope: `repo` (all permissions)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

**Step 2:** Push using the token
```bash
git push https://KarimF430:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/KarimF430/ZSCV.git main
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you copied.

### Option 3: Set up SSH (One-time setup)

**Step 1:** Check if you have SSH keys
```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

If you see `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have SSH keys!

**Step 2:** Add your SSH key to GitHub
1. Copy your public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
2. Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Click "New SSH key"
4. Paste your key and save

**Step 3:** Change remote and push
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:KarimF430/ZSCV.git
git push origin main
```
